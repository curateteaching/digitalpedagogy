# FAQ: DIGITAL PEDAGOGY IN THE HUMANITIES: CONCEPTS, MODELS, AND EXPERIMENTS

## Q: Should curators circulate a formal CFP?
A: No. Feel free to crowdsource suggestions from your networks, but please do not create a CFP.  We are encouraging less of a formal submission/review/accept/reject model and more of an informal, “send some links” model. It is  the curator's job to select and curate 10 links and to explain things in the curator's statement. Additional links collected through a crowdsourced process may be shared through the "Related Materials" section, perhaps through a link to a document that contains a larger list of suggestions.

## Q: If I decide to make a public call for suggestions, what should my request include?
A: The curator should indicate that she/he will be able to include only 10 responses and that she/he is serving as curator of this particular keyword and not of the whole collection. Please use our project hashtag (#curateteaching) when making a public call.

## Q: Whose work should be included in a keyword?
A: The keyword should speak to a range of assignments/institutions, with a privileging of undergrads but some inclusion of graduate education. We would like the collection to go beyond the usual suspects/circles, to be inclusive, to speak to a range of levels of instruction, to avoid the appearance of impropriety, etc.

## Q: What other keywords have been included in this project?
A: See the draft list of keywords included in this repository.

## Q: What kind of content are you looking for?
A: The keywords should place an emphasis on pedagogy, not just a list of assignments. We aim to distribute not reflective narratives about teaching, but rather curated teaching materials. Aim for a balance of types of artifacts. See the description of curated artifacts in the [template](keywords/!template.md#curated-artifacts-ten-artifacts-each-with-metadata-a-screenshot-and-a-150-word-annotation).

## Q: Can I include my own work?
A: Yes, but we want to go beyond the usual suspects and circles to include a wide, balanced variety of artifacts by a wide and balanced variety of authors.

## Q: Can I include work by the General Editors?
A: Yes, but we want to go beyond the usual suspects and circles.

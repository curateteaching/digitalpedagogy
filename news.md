## Update April 1, 2020 - WE'RE LIVE!
*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities* has emerged on its Modern Language Association platform in a beta form and being corrected live through June 2020. In light of the widespread move to online education at most universities, both the MLA staff and editors Davis, Gold, and Harris agreed that opening up the project in its post-peer review, copyedited state would be beneficial for everyone. Please join us in welcoming this long-standing project in its final platform into the world: [*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities*(https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/)

### Open Peer Review for Third Batch of Keywords NOW OPEN - Ends February 22

At this year’s MLA convention in Austin, the editors of *Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments*, Rebecca Frost Davis, Matthew K. Gold, Katherine D. Harris, and Jentery Sayers, demonstrated the project’s innovative platform to an enthusiastic crowd. Now they invite you to continue the conversation by participating in the open peer-review process of the anthology’s third set of curated keywords. Each entry in the collection focuses on a keyword in the practice of digital pedagogy (ranging from “play” to “collaboration” to “design”), is curated by an experienced practitioner of digital pedagogy, and is supported by ten pedagogical artifacts, such as syllabi, prompts, exercises, lesson plans, Web sites, and student work drawn from courses, classrooms, and projects across the humanities.

Please visit https://digitalpedagogy.commons.mla.org to read and review the third set of keywords, now available for open review. The official review period for the third set of keywords will end on 22 February 2016. To allow those who discovered the project at the convention to fully participate in the volume’s development, the deadline for the second set of curated keywords has been extended to 31 January 2016. New keywords will be added in batches throughout 2016, with fifty keywords to be included in the final project.

### Open Peer Review for Third Batch of Keywords NOW OPEN - Ends February 22

At this year’s MLA convention in Austin, the editors of *Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments*, Rebecca Frost Davis, Matthew K. Gold, Katherine D. Harris, and Jentery Sayers, demonstrated the project’s innovative platform to an enthusiastic crowd. Now they invite you to continue the conversation by participating in the open peer-review process of the anthology’s third set of curated keywords. Each entry in the collection focuses on a keyword in the practice of digital pedagogy (ranging from “play” to “collaboration” to “design”), is curated by an experienced practitioner of digital pedagogy, and is supported by ten pedagogical artifacts, such as syllabi, prompts, exercises, lesson plans, Web sites, and student work drawn from courses, classrooms, and projects across the humanities.

Please visit https://digitalpedagogy.commons.mla.org to read and review the third set of keywords, now available for open review. The official review period for the third set of keywords will end on 22 February 2016. To allow those who discovered the project at the convention to fully participate in the volume’s development, the deadline for the second set of curated keywords has been extended to 31 January 2016. New keywords will be added in batches throughout 2016, with fifty keywords to be included in the final project.

*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments*, edited by Rebecca Frost Davis, Matthew K. Gold, Katherine D.

New keywords will be added in batches throughout 2015, with fifty keywords to be included in the final project.

Please visit [https://digitalpedagogy.commons.mla.org](https://digitalpedagogy.commons.mla.org) to read through and respond to the first set of keywords, now available for open review. The official review period for the first set of keywords will end on 3 August 2015.

155. Curating Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities
7:00–8:15 p.m., Franklin 3, Philadelphia Marriott
A special session

Presiding: Katherine D. Harris, San José State Univ.

Speakers: Lauren Coats, Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge; Anne Cong-Huyen, Whittier Coll.; Rebecca Davis, St. Edward’s Univ.; Matthew K. Gold, Graduate Center, City Univ. of New York; Elizabeth Mathews Losh, Coll. of William and Mary

Respondent: Zach Whalen, Univ. of Mary Washington

This session addresses the shifting definitions of digital pedagogy by focusing on some of the important practices that help define it. Each participant presents sample teaching materials related to a particular aspect of digital pedagogy before discussing how open digital publishing has revolutionized pedagogy through broad sharing, reusing, and hacking of digital assignments.

keywords: digital pedagogy, digital humanities, pedagogy

After a brief introduction to the panel’s rationale by Katherine D. Harris, each speaker will offer 5-7
minute remarks, followed by a response by Zach Whalen. The roundtable will then move to open
discussion.

Presider *Katherine D. Harris* will open the roundtable by explaining how the digital has changed practices,
perspectives, and locations for humanities pedagogy. Open digital publishing has revolutionized pedagogy
through broad sharing, reusing, and hacking of digital assignments. The digitization of primary sources
enables students to engage in authentic research activities, while increasingly available digital tools offer
new avenues for students to analyse humanities materials. Finally, the digital has changed the classroom
itself, blurring the geographical, temporal, and personal lines between class, community, and globe,
through ongoing collaborative projects and opportunities to interact with all sorts of audiences.

*Rebecca Frost Davis* will discuss how digital teaching practices can foster open processes of scholarly
production, leveraging digital tools and networks to reveal knowledge creation. Moving humanities
teaching practices out of the space of solitary classrooms and into participatory networks, Davis will show,
extends the reach of humanities work and opens it up to multiple communities.

*Matthew K. Gold* will explore how open publishing systems can be used to engage humanist pedagogues
in new publication workflows related to their teaching, sharing course materials on open platforms and
blurring the lines between teaching and research. Bringing pedagogical materials into open publication
workflows lets students and the larger public see and participate in humanities education.

Following these general discussions of digital pedagogy, connected learning, and digital publishing, the
roundtable will turn to particular keywords of digital pedagogy such as “archive,” “affect,” and “gender.”

*Elizabeth Losh* will explore the intersection of digital pedagogy and affect. Shared learning projects around
coding in Processing, creating webtexts in Scalar, editing Wikipedia, building 3D prototypes, curating
critical selfies, and delivering Ignite-style presentations all require sensitivity to the register of affect.
Critical questions include the following: How are digital skills gendered? How are hybrid or online classrooms constituted as safe or brave spaces? What are the consequences of demo-or-die practices?
Does an ethos that celebrates failure work for everyone? How do students feel about digital mess? What
are the ethical obligations of pedagogues to combat online racism or misogyny that can be so psychically
hurtful?

*Lauren Coats* will address the way the digital has transformed the archive and implications for archivefocused
pedagogy. Investigations of the archive make literature and literary history tangible. The focus on
the object that is at the heart of archival pedagogy helps students grasp the materiality of textual artifacts
and grapple with the relationship of form and content. By relying on wonder, mediation, and curation in
many kinds of classes—from the special collections single session to the survey course to the advanced
seminar—the use of archival materials, digital or analog, requires thinking about the archive itself. More
broadly, archival practice gives students a compelling introduction to the intellectual consequences of
curation, the many choices about an object's archival fate that determine if and how future users will see
and use it.

*Anne Cong-Huyen* will address both embodied gender and gendered practice as they dictate and create a
structure within the politics of the classroom community. When students are conscious of their own
identities, privileges, expectations, such self-awareness allows them to to interrogate their long-held
beliefs, question how those beliefs were formed, and puts pressure on assumptions about the neutrality of
a text or tool. Are their texts really epitomes of genius regardless of gender, race, and class? What
privilege does the very act of writing, of coding, of tinkering speak to? Such questions are common to the
humanities, but digital practices can expand scope of examination to tools, texts, and environments that
students are immersed in on a daily basis.

Respondent *Zach Whalen* will offer a response to the presentations and draw out connections between
them, also articulating a number of points for further discussion with the audience.

## Update April 1, 2020 - WE'RE LIVE!
*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities* has emerged on its Modern Language Association platform in a beta form and being corrected live through June 2020. In light of the widespread move to online education at most universities, both the MLA staff and editors Davis, Gold, and Harris agreed that opening up the project in its post-peer review, copyedited state would be beneficial for everyone. Please join us in welcoming this long-standing project in its final platform into the world: [*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities*(https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/)

## CURATORIAL STATEMENT

In December of 1991, Art Spiegelman wrote to the editor of the *New York Times*. He was pleased that the second volume of his memoir *Maus* had appeared on December 8 “Best Seller List,” but dismayed to discover it appeared under the *fiction* list. “If your list were divided into literature and nonliterature, I could gracefully accept the compliment as intended, but to the extent that ‘fiction’ indicates a work isn’t factual, I feel a bit queasy,” he insisted.

Similar ambiguities attend any attempt to put clear borders on the category *fiction*. This is, no doubt, in great part its power—that, as in *Maus*, comic mice can renarrate the Holocaust; or in Toni Morrison’s *Beloved*, the real history of Margaret Garner can be refracted through what may appear to be a ghost story. Yet, if “fiction” were defined chiefly by its opposition to “truthfulness,” teachers of fiction would be responsible for a range of materials broad enough to include not only novels and movies, but fables, fairy tales, and lies (to say nothing of statistics or political speeches).

Teaching fiction often means trying to understand this peculiar power: how does the fiction—the ostensibly “untrue”—nevertheless become powerful through its representations? In practice, this involves questions of narrative and plot, a sensitivity to form and style, and the histories (material and conceptual) of all of these terms. Why does a story feel like it has a sense of closure? When does it not? And what are the meanings—political and otherwise—of such closure? What are the devices by which we come to recognize and view a story from a particular perspective? How does a single work of fiction’s participation in a genre shape our expectations and our understanding of the story? Moreover, studying fiction also invites reflection on *medium*; as the “same” story moves across genres—a process amply illustrated, for instance, by the many versions (dramatic, illustrated, filmed, etc) of Bram Stoker’s *Dracula* which began appearing soon after its initial publication. Teaching of fiction, therefore, requires weaving together close attention to the histories and textures of particular works, with larger threads: longer political and social histories; the rise and fall of genres; and narrative structures broader than any single medium or genre.

Teaching questions of narrative, character, perspective, and medium is often made richer through the affordances of the digital. Online editions, distant reading, and similar resources, help articulate and make explicit processes that predate the digital. At the same time, the digital, as itself a form for new works of fiction, helps reveal the ways that works of fiction are shaped by, and reshape, the medium in which they appear. The items collected below attend to both the specificity of particular works and the larger trends that shape such works. These resources are organized roughly into two categories based on the scale of the object they address. Under `TEXTS` are resources that take as their organizing focus a single text. The digital editions—Katherine Harris’s *Frankenstein* Digital Edition assignment and *Infinite Ulysses*—use the individual work as an occasion for gathering and rearranging the parts and pieces which make up the creation, publication, and reception of works of fiction. Such resources and assignments excavate the allusions and the histories (of text, gender, and nation) embedded within a work. The game IVANHOE, typically (though not necessarily) organized around a single work, invites its players into roles that are not so different from those of editors. Its players enter into a text to take it apart and piece together again, understanding it by remaking it. The other materials in this section focus on intratextual phenomena—character networks or the examination of the evolution of epithets, as methods for better understanding a text. They provide avenues less for connecting a single text to the larger forces and networks in which it participates, than for exposing the the complexities it contains.

The materials arranged under `GENRE` offer a look at narrative fiction at scales greater than the individual work. Perhaps the most unexpected item in this collection, Teju Cole’s collection of tweets rewriting canonical novels, tackles the genre of literary fiction (the “classic”) from the perspective of the present. Other items in this list look to Sherlock Holmes stories, the history of the novel, or the structure of narrative itself (as reflected in TV and film). These resources all work not to reveal something larger than any single work can contain. Rather than sensitizing us to the complexities of a single work, they help to expose the conventions and commonalities that are shared between works. This section also includes txtLAB’s corpus of 450 novels, a set of novels ideal for larger scale analysis of fiction in the context of a class. (One can find an even larger corpus—or rather, its metadata—under **“Related Materials”**: data for roughly 32,000 works of fiction contained in [HathiTrust](https://www.hathitrust.org/). 

The list ranges from datasets, to games, to works of creative fiction. Some involve using digital tools to expand or complicate the traditional study of fiction, while others play with the form of fiction itself, helping us to understand works of fiction by making the genre strange and unfamiliar. Some of these resources are ready for use in the classroom, while others are offered as inspiration, demonstrating some of the opportunities afforded by the “digital” for the study of fiction. Collected and presented here, they are meant to capture the wide range of things that one teaches when one teaches fiction.

## CURATED ARTIFACTS

### TEXT

#### *Frankenstein* Digital Edition Assignment
![screenshot](images/fiction-screenshot-frankenstein.png)

* URL: [http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/harris/TechnoRom_F09/Assignments.htm#FinalProj](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/harris/TechnoRom_F09/Assignments.htm#FinalProj)
* Type: Assignment
* Creator: [Katherine Harris](https://triproftri.wordpress.com/) (San José State University)

Katherine Harris’s TechnoRomanticism class is structured around uses single large assignment—a digital edition of *Frankenstein*—to scaffold a semester’s work. Such an edition provides a tangible way of exploring how works of fiction emerge and develop historically. The assignment involves a number of skills, some broadly analytical others more specifically digital,  all grounded in the collaborative creation of a digital edition of a major text. The semester-spanning assignment provides a model that could be adapted to a variety of texts and contexts. It allows a single text to be the avenue through which a range of questions are asked, foregrounding questions of history—context, textual materiality, and medium—that treatments of genre or  “narrative” in the abstract might otherwise ignore.

#### Infinite Ulysses
![screenshot](images/fiction-screenshot-ulysses.png)

* URL: [http://www.infiniteulysses.com/](http://www.infiniteulysses.com/)
* Creator: [Amanda Visconti](http://literaturegeek.com/) [http://www.amandavisconti.com/](http://www.amandavisconti.com/)
* Type: Digital Edition
* License: Most of the data (the text of *Ulysses*, the annotations, other page data) are licensed [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/). For details about the site’s code, see its [github repository](https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-public).

*Infinite Ulysses* is one of the most sophisticated online editions currently available. For readers of *Ulysses* it is a wonderful resource, both for teaching and reading. More broadly, however, *Infinite Ulysses* offers the best illustration of the potential and possibilities of collaborative reading and annotation, akin to what Alan Liu has described as “social reading.” The range of materials that people use to annotate and enrich the collective, collaborative edition of *Ulysses* illustrates the ways that a single text can be enriched by cross-references, annotation, and contextual materials of various sorts.

#### Character Networks in Gephi (or Word, for the Low-Fi Lovers)
![screenshot](images/fiction-screenshot-characternetworks.png)

* Source URL: [http://chuckrybak.com/characters-networks-in-gephi-or-word-for-the-low-fi-lovers/](http://chuckrybak.com/characters-networks-in-gephi-or-word-for-the-low-fi-lovers/)
* Type: Assignment
* Creator: [Chuck Rybak](http://chuckrybak.com/) (University of Wisconsin—Green Bay)

This assignment uses a single question—the relationship between a novel’s characters—to both think about a novel, and to illustrate principles of digital textual analysis. It asks students to generate “data” from their reading, by *observing* and *noticing* when, and how, characters interact. The assignment takes this information and transforms it into a network visualization that itself provides a goad and inspiration for reflection on the work of literature. The result is an assignment that moves from the process of reading, to the collection and analysis of data, to reflection on its meaning. It is an ideal assignment for introducing such types of analysis. In asking students to generate the data by hand, it also helpfully illustrates [Johanna Drucker’s suggestion that “all data is capta,”](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html) that is, constructed with a specific set of assumptions and uses.
 
In [a valuable discussion of the assignment](http://chuckrybak.com/teaching/dh-toe-dip-character-networks-in-gephi/) Rybak notes that the assignment was inspired by one of the Stanford Lit Lab’s pamphlets on Hamlet and [“Network Theory, Plot Analysis”](http://litlab.stanford.edu/LiteraryLabPamphlet2.pdf)) and provides an illuminating account of its development. 

####  “Visualizing a Changing Nostromo”
![screenshot](images/fiction_tanigawa_nostromo.png)

* [http://www.conradfirst.net/conrad/scholarship/authors/tanigawa
](http://www.conradfirst.net/conrad/scholarship/authors/tanigawa)
* Creator: [Katie Tanigawa](http://maker.uvic.ca/author/katie/) (University of Victoria)
* Type: Article

Katie Tanigawa’s article examines the epithets and appellations of a single character (the eponymous Nostromo) across three different textual versions of Conrad’s novel. The result exploits textual markup technologies to combine an analysis of to the representation of character with a sensitivity to textual history. It reveals two useful points for the student of fiction: how small elements, like how characters are named, can prove vital to our understanding of fiction; and, how such matters are themselves products of particular material histories. 

While reproducing Tanigawa’s analysis, which requires time-consuming [TEI](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) markup followed by visualization with the [Mandala browser](http://mandala.humviz.org/), is probably not feasible in most classroom contexts, her article offers a model for how to begin to think about such questions. Tracing, collecting, and collating the appellations of a character or characters *is* something that a class could easily do as they read. And this data could be explored in less labor-intensive ways, using tools like [word trees](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/), simple term frequencies, other [text analysis tools](./textanalysis.md), or even by manual comparison. For another digital analysis of names in fiction see Dalen-Oskam.

#### IVANHOE

* URL: [http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/](http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/)
* Creator: [The Scholars Lab](http://scholarslab.org/) (University of Virginia)
* Type: Application / Game

Originally conceived in 2000-2001, the game of IVANHOE encourages players to treat literary texts or other works as a game of interpretation. It offers a loose framework of rules and conventions for transforming a text (or set of texts) into a role-playing game. While IVANHOE can be played with paper and pen, the Scholars Lab has recently released a new version of IVANHOE as a a WordPress plugin.

The goal of *IVANHOE*, Johanna Drucker explains, was to offer “a model digital environment for next-generation pedagogy and scholarship” (*SpecLab* 65). It is designed to “provoke critical modes of reading within literary studies.” But it is also “a toy and a tool” (*SpecLab* 66). Of the items on this list, IVANHOE comes the closest to suggesting that the best way to understand the workings of fiction, are to create a work of fiction. A similar, but much smaller scale, assignment, “Role Playing *Dorian Gray*,” is listed under **Related Materials**.

### GENRE

#### Teju Cole, “Seven Stories About Drones”
![screenshot](images/fiction_drone-stories.png)

* Source URL: [https://thenewinquiry.com/blog/seven-short-stories-about-drones/](https://thenewinquiry.com/blog/seven-short-stories-about-drones/)
* Type: Text
* Creator: Teju Cole

Cole’s “Seven Short Stories” rewrites the iconic opening of major novels (*Mrs. Dalloway*, *Things Fall Apart*, and others), upsetting their canonical force with the violence of the United States’ 21st-century foreign policy. If the stories “deform” classic novels to highlight the violence of contemporary the “war on terror,” they also exploit the limitations/affordances of Twitter. Each of the seven stories initially appeared as a tweet, limited to 140 characters. The *tweet*, as a narrative form, is explored elsewhere by Cole (“Hafiz” and “A Piece of the Wall”), as well as by Jennifer Egan in her techno-thriller in miniature “Black Box”; all these works invite discussion about the narrative form, and affordances, of tweet. Can one tell a whole story in a tweet? What sorts of stories are better suited to a tweet? What sorts of story resist it? How do these narrative affordances of the tweet contrast with those of the works Cole here rewrites? In this way, “Seven Stories About Drones” is valuable even in pedagogical contexts not focused on digital, or new media, literature. In considering questions of narrative form and genre, it may be worth noting that Cole’s drone tweets are similar to his set of tweet-length fictions, inspired by the French newspaper genre *fait divers*, [“Small Fates”](http://www.tejucole.com/small-fates/). “Small Fates,” like the *fait divers*, invite reflection on the relationship between medium and genre, on literature and politics, on canonicity and contemporary politics. (Cole’s interview with Sarah Zhang offers valuable reflection on these works.)

#### Teaching Literature Through Technology: Sherlock Holmes and Digital Humanities
![screenshot](images/fiction-screenshot-teachingliterature.png)

* Source URL: [http://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/teaching-literature-through-technology-sherlock-holmes-and-digital-humanities/](http://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/teaching-literature-through-technology-sherlock-holmes-and-digital-humanities/)
* Type: Article
* Creator: [Annie Swafford](https://annieswafford.wordpress.com/) (SUNY—New Paltz)

Detective fiction generally, and the Sherlock Holmes stories in particular, offer invaluable case studies for thinking about plots and narrative more broadly, as well as questions of *genre*. They have also been the object of interesting reflection by critics including (to name favorites from my own teaching) Franco Moretti and W. H. Auden.

In this article, Annie Swafford describes teaching a DH course centered around such stories, though many of her exercises could be used on any piece of fiction. Swafford’s class offers a rich set of digital labs that bring together the use of digital tools with reflection on questions of genre. Swafford describes using [word trees](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/), which allow an an easy comparison of the different ways in which the characters "Holmes" and "Adler" are described in "A Scandal in Bohemia." The result is a particularly savvy way of bringing such analysis together with questions of genre, narrative, and gender, in a manner amenable to the classroom. Using the [word tree tool](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/) Swafford describes, however, a similar comparison could be done between *any* characters in any text---either as an assignment for students, or collectively in class, to explore the ways a character or location within a story is described, and how those descriptions compare with others, or change over the course of the work.

#### Rise of the Novel Syllabus
![screenshot](images/fiction-screenshot-riseofthenovel.png)

* Source URL: [https://github.com/rbuurma/rise-2017/blob/master/Syllabus/rise-2017-syllabus-final.pdf](https://github.com/rbuurma/rise-2017/blob/master/Syllabus/rise-2017-syllabus-final.pdf)
* Type: Syllabus
* Creator: [Rachel Sagner Buurma](http://rachelsagnerbuurma.org/) (Swarthmore College)

Novels are perhaps the most important genre of fiction, and understanding the history of this genre is crucial to a complete understanding of fiction. 

This syllabus integrates a variety of digital tools (including Named Entity Recognition, Digitization, [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/)) into a survey of the rise of the novel with a masterful selection of primary texts and literary theory. The result is a syllabus that manages to simultaneously cover a key subject in literary history (the emergence, growth, and evolution of the novel as a genre), while critically scrutinizing that very narrative, and providing introductions to a range of tools of approaches in the process. The tools are not merely tacked on, but are integral to the examination of the “rise” of the novel the syllabus offers.

The class's [assignments](https://github.com/rbuurma/rise-2017/tree/master/Assignments) provide an ideal model for how to integrate digital tools alongside more conventional activities (e.g. close reading, descriptive bibliography).

#### Fundamental Plot Arcs, Seen Through Multidimensional Analysis of thousands of TV and Movie Scripts
![screenshot](images/fiction-screenshot-wordsinscreentime.png)

* Source URL: [http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2014/12/fundamental-plot-arcs-seen-through.html](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2014/12/fundamental-plot-arcs-seen-through.html)
* Type: Blog Post
* Creator: Ben Schmidt

The structuring role of *plot* is central "fiction," but cuts across media. This analysis of television and film narrative provides a model for thinking about the structure of plots that would be valuable in any fiction classroom. Even without [the impressive database of film/tv scripts](http://movies.benschmidt.org/), or the sophisticated statistical tools Schmidt uses to analyze them, this post begins by examining a simple question: where is the phrase "I love you" most likely to occur in a text. This simple question opens up a compelling way to explore basic questions about *plot*. 

Schmidt’s analysis in this post begins with phrases, and goes on to examine more sophisticated measures of narrative. , 
While Schmidt’s method by the end of this post (plotting the *principal components* of the *topics* extracted from topic modeling) is too advanced for almost any class not focused on computational approaches to literature, the broader questions of Schmidt’s analysis—using words, phrases, or topics to examine and compare plots—can be valuably repurposed. Similar questions about how to analyze plot, and by what measures, are at stake in the debates about plot and sentiment discussed in Jocker’s “Revealing Sentiment and Plot Arcs with the Syuzhet Package” and Swafford’s “Why Syuzhet Doesn’t Work and How We Know,” listed under **Related Materials**.

#### txtLAB450
![screenshot](images/fiction-screenshot-txtlab450.png)

* Source URL: [http://txtlab.org/?p=601](http://txtlab.org/?p=601)
* Type: Dataset
* Creator: [txtLab](http://txtlab.org/) (McGill University)

If you’re looking for the text of a particular work of fiction for analysis, your best bet is likely [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) or [The Oxford Text Archive](https://ota.ox.ac.uk/). If however you are looking for a curated dataset to examine (or "distantly read) *fiction* as a genre (meaning, here, essentially novels), the `.txtLab`’s txtLab450 offers “a multilingual data set of novels for teaching and research.” This set of novels is large enough to offer a practice set for a class exploring distant reading approaches to fiction, without being unmanageable or difficult to use for a single user with a laptop.

The dataset is a collection of 150 novels in English, 151 novels in French, 151 novels in German, and represents novels from the “long nineteenth century (1770-1930).” In addition, the dataset describes each novel according to year of publication, gender of author, and the narrative perspective (first or third person) in which the novel is written. Such metadata allows for more interesting and subtle analysis than the text of the novels alone would. (For an example of how this data might be used, see Piper). A larger dataset, containing English Fiction from 1700 - 1899 drawn from the HathiTrust dataset, is listed below, under **Related Materials**.

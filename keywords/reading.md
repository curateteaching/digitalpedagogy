## CURATORIAL STATEMENT

In the beginning, we learn to read; after we are literate, we read to learn. In this received wisdom, reading is only temporarily difficult, material, intractable; afterwards, it recedes into the background, becoming the transparent skill through which we access worlds of knowledge. But we are in fact always learning to read and always learning about reading as we encounter new languages, genres, and forms, and mediums.

How we learn about reading’s past, present, and future seems especially important right now. Reading has been transformed by digital media and computation, by the computer screen and the e-reader—just as it was by the advent of machine printing, by the Gutenberg press, by advances in manuscript production, and by the shift from scroll to codex, as well as by social and historical changes in everything from the economics of book production to literacy and access to education. According to the most anxious reports, the advent of the screen is destroying our ability to read deeply, slowly, and linearly. “It is a cliché universally acknowledged,” writes Rita Raley in the introduction to her “Distracted Reading” syllabus,

> that we (where “we” means, variously, the Twitter generation, the Millennial generation, participants in the Network Society) no longer read, or if we do read, we read poorly, with insufficient attention and affect. Reading, by which is meant literary reading, is said to be a “lost art” and certainly “at risk.” We multitask and thus cannot sustain the kind of focus and attention required for a long, complex narrative.

Of course, as students of reading hastily reply, we have always read discontinuously, extensively, and intermittently as often as we have read in long uninterrupted stretches and intensively. Accordingly, all of the syllabi and assignments featured here take the current moment as an opportunity to rethink reading’s history. Each seeks to take the measure of the continuities and discontinuities between the codex’s papery page and the page as represented on the screen.

The fundamental uncertainty over what it means to add the electronic text - with its distributed nature and unfamiliar materialities - to an ecosystem of literary reading  previously defined by the bound and bounded book (not to mention the printed form, the magazine, the newspaper, the manuscript, and the typescript) leads to a new pedagogical challenge for teachers whose fundamental charge is to teach students “how to read.” How do we begin to teach students to understand the relationship between page and screen if we have only begun to grasp it ourselves? Thinking about the power dynamics of reading in *Jane Austen and the Secret of Style*, D.A. Miller notes the dangers of “being read reading”(2). Reading in the digital age reduces none of these complications of reading’s relation to identity and survival, but it raises yet another specter: the possibility that we are “being read” as data by machines as well as by humans.

Machine reading has a longer history than we sometimes assume. Work on the nineteenth- and twentieth-century history of [talking books](https://audiobookhistory.wordpress.com/author/mattrubery/) and [other reading machines](https://soundstudiesblog.com/2015/01/05/optophones-and-musical-print/) shows how [reading technologies developed to convert text into sound for blind readers](http://maker.uvic.ca/schema/) questioned assumptions about the nature of reading while also contributing to the development of machine reading technologies like optical character recognition (OCR). In the realm of literary interpretation as “reading,” of course, Stephen Ramsay has famously emphasized the continuities between human and machine. For Ramsay, literary criticism already contains “elements of the algorithmic.” Both machine and literary-critical reading have in common a tendency towards strict repetitive protocols, and both rely "on a heuristic of radical transformation."
Any critic, whether using close or distant methods, who "endeavors to put forth a “reading” puts forth not the text, but a new text in which the data has been paraphrased, elaborated, selected, truncated, and transduced (*Reading Machines: Towards an Algorithmic Criticism,* 16).

Many of the assignments collected here show us this continuity in action. Whether they ask students to keep a commonplace book on a Pinterest board or teach close reading through Markdown encoding, each reveals how the protocols of historical readers and reading communities find affinities with or form the origins of computational or digital forms.

The study of reading’s history spills outside traditional boundaries of discipline and department, and takes place in special collections library reading rooms and computer labs as well as classrooms. The course on the history of reading in the west from scroll and codex to the ebook and computer screen is a genre in its own right; examples are Ann Blair’s [History of the Book and of Reading](http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~hist1318/), Timothy Burke’s [The History of Reading](http://blogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/syllabi/history-62-the-history-of-reading-spring-2012/), and Adrian Johns’s [A History of Reading](http://home.uchicago.edu/~johns/historyofreading). But the pasts, presents, and futures of reading make their way into a much wider range of syllabi, appearing in classes on topics ranging from literature, book history, and digital humanities to user experience and web design, cognitive science, and library and information science.

The following exercises, projects, and resources bring the continuities and disjunctions between print and digital forms to the fore, and ask students to interrogate cultural messages and social assumptions about reading—their own and others’—by historicizing reading, reflecting on their own modes of engaging with texts on and offline, and speculating on the futures of reading. These assignments rise to the challenge of grappling with reading today by taking hold of one of the most longstanding, traditional aspects of humanities pedagogy: the classroom’s role as a place where students and teachers both create *and* transmit new knowledge together. Just as digital technology and social media have given the collective aspects of reading a new visibility (if also a new ephemerality)—we can turn on social highlighting on our e-readers, comment on blog posts, or socially bookmark—so too has digital pedagogy brought a new kind of visibility to the longstanding practices through which students and teachers have created knowledge together in the classroom. Whether they imagine reading as distracted, discontinuous, materialized, black-boxed, close, distant, human, or mechanical, these assignments work to reveal that reading is social even when it feels most solitary. Whether we read alone in front of  a screen, aloud in a place of worship, or silently in a crowded library, they show us, the practices of reading are always both material and collective.

## CURATED ARTIFACTS

### Topic: Discontinuous Reading

#### Cut/Copy/Paste: Remixing Words

Whitney Ann Trettien’s “Cut/Copy/Paste: Remixing Words” (Duke University, Spring 2012) unsettles the apparent opposition between writing and reading, explaining to her students that “you cannot read the texts of this class without, in some sense, writing them, and we’ll spend a good deal of time doing both in and out of class.” Her syllabus traces the history of readers who have remixed old texts to create new experimental writing, inviting her students to from Latin cut-up poems to seventeenth-century German paper instruments to generative computer programs. Trettian’s readings and exercises insistently emphasize the materiality of both page *and* screen, expertly preempting the inscription of a material/dematerialized divide between the printed and the digital book, an especially tricky aspect of digital pedagogy. The brief, specific exercises - including instructions to excerpt, extract, cut up, collage, and auto-generate writing via both human and machine - could be integrated into anything from a first-year writing class to an upper-level history of reading or literature class to help students think about the materiality of reading and writing.

#### Theory and Practice of Hypertext

Hypertext was revelatory to scholars in the humanities because it held out the possibility of rendering visible the interconnected webs of citations scholars see when they read. Courses on hypertext genres proliferated in the 1980s and 1990s. John Unsworth’s ENSP 482: Theory and Practice of Hypertext (University of Virginia, Spring 1999) introduces students to the possibilities of discontinuous, non-narrative, online reading and writing. The course begins with a brief history and how-to, moves through classic hypertext texts, and includes several weeks of project-based work before finishing with an investigation of emerging hypertext genres (critical, creative, autobiographial). Unsworth’s syllabus offers a useful survey of hypertext theory and practice that would be a useful addition to courses on electronic literature or the history of narrative, and would make compelling reading for any methods of literary study class examining citation practices.

#### The Commonplace Book Assignment

* Creator and Affiliation: [Vimala Pasupathi](https://vcpasupathi.wordpress.com/), Hofstra University

This assignment reimagines the short close reading paper as a commonplace book. Connecting early modern commonplacing to contemporary uses of Pinterest and Tumblr, Pasupathi asks students to create their own commonplace book by copying out weekly passages from the assigned Shakespeare play and writing paragraph-long close readings of each passage using in “a hard-copy diary of sorts, or on the web as a blog, Tumblr, or Pinterest page.” Another version of the assignment might also ask students to look first at [digitized commonplace books](http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/reading/commonplace.html) like those in the “commonplace books” section of the online exhibit *Reading: Harvard Views of Readers, Readership, and Reading History* as examples. In an upper-level undergraduate or a graduate class, this assignment could scale all the way up to asking students to build and maintain a commonplace book of research or open research notebook on the model of [Whitney Ann Trettien’s](http://whitneyannetrettien.com/whiki/index.php?title=Main_Page), [W. Caleb McDaniel’s](http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu), or [Shawn Graham’s](http://shawngraham.github.io/).

This site includes a collaboratively-created digital edition of the nineteenth-century friendship album of Amy Matilda Cassey, a prominent member of Philadelphia’s black middle class. As the site notes, Cassey is a significant figure in part because she was was an active member of “the Philadelphia Female Antislavery Society, local black literary and debating societies, and other reform movements.” Her album “is filled with calligraphed poems, inscriptions, essays sketches and watercolors which illuminate and further document the active and intimate connections of Philadelphia’s black leaders to a larger network of activists and reformers” including contributions from Sarah Mapps Douglass, Margaretta Forten, Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, and Wendell Phillips. The extensive annotations on the Cassey album were created by the [Early African American Print Cultures class](http://lcpalbumproject.org/?page_id=173) of Swarthmore professor Lara Cohen in collaboration with Library Company’s Curator of African American History Krystal Appiah. The work of metadata creation, transcription, and annotation prompted the students to think in sustained ways about the remediations involved when the historical records of private reading and writing are transformed in order to allow, in the words of the students’ unpublished research narrative, “public readerships to find significance in private networks.”

### Topic: Distracted Reading

* Artifact Permissions:

In this syllabus, Rita Raley asks students to reflect on a series of large questions about the present of reading. Working through debates over contemporary reading practices while turning back to historicize earlier modes of attention to the page, Raley’s syllabus models the transformation of a  binarized classroom battle over students’ attachment to screens vs professorial desire for deep engagement with the printed text into a generative, collaborative pedagogical undertaking. The syllabus offers a number of extractable clusters of readings that might fit into a more general history of reading, of the book, or of electronic literature syllabus.

### Topic: Historical Traces

#### Book Traces

In this assignment, students learn from and contribute to [Book Traces](http://www.booktraces.org/), a project that crowdsources records of marginalia from nineteenth-century books from the open stacks of libraries. They search the library catalog, locate physical books on the shelf, page through them to find marginalia, photographically document it, and finally write a short blog post explaining “what the traces have to do with the topic of the book and the pages on which they appear.” Connecting the digital library catalog with the book on the shelf and the process of digital documentation with the study of paleography, the assignment gives students a very concrete way to think about the relation between the annotation and documentation practices of nineteenth-century readers and their own.

UK RED “is an open-access database housed at The Open University containing over 30,000 easily searchable records documenting the history of reading in Britain from 1450 to 1945. Evidence of reading presented in UK RED is drawn from published and unpublished sources as diverse as diaries, commonplace books, memoirs, sociological surveys, and criminal court and prison records.” A mine of primary material with about reading including careful metadata about reader, author, text, and place, the growing UK RED database could be the basis for assignments comparing the reception history of a single text across time, tracking the reading of individual readers, or looking at many readers’ responses to a single text.

Scholars and students of the history of reading have disproved - over and over again - Benedict Anderson’s famous description of reading as something that, despite its social function, takes place “in silent privacy, in the lair of the skull” (34-35). Digital platforms, tools, and practices have made reading’s public traces more accessible than ever, both by providing new ways for readers to intentionally capture and share comments and conversations (comment functions, annotation apps, social bookmarking, and article sharing) and by the sometimes less intentional and desirable capture of our reading histories by our web browsers. Amanda Visconti’s  Infinite Ulysses offers the basis for many possible assignments in which students might help socially annotate Joyce’s famously difficult book. But it also acts as a model for other possible annotation projects. Asking students to use hypothes.is to collectively annotate a course reading as Jack Dougherty does in his [How to annotate with Hypothes.is assignment](http://commons.trincoll.edu/cssp/seminar/annotate-with-hypothesis/), or designing [an assignment in which students create plain-text footnotes for a chapter of a contemporary novel](https://lauraheffernan.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lit-4093-footnote-assignment.pdf) as Laura Heffernan does in her [21st-Century Literature](https://lauraheffernan.wordpress.com/teaching-2/) course are other ways one could capture the spirit of *Infinite Ulysses* in a lightweight assignment.

### Topic: Machine Reading and Human Reading

#### Digital Markdown Edition of a Poem

Ross’s digital edition assignment asks students to "think beyond the word processor." Students choose a poem from the class syllabus and create a full digital edition ready for online publication, including careful transcription of the poem, author biography, bibliography, introduction to the poem’s cultural and historical contexts, and at least fifteen word annotations. Revising this assignment to include more engagement with plain-text authoring conventions like Markdown could draw on parts of Programming Historian’s [Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown) tutorial by Dennis Tenen and Grant Wythoff. Another version of this exercise could use TEI encoding to engage students in a similar slow, active creation of an edited text and provoke some related meditations on textual encoding’s relation to literary meaning and interpretation. This assignment also suggests a flipped version in which students would close read a marked-up text or even a snippet of code rather than using markup or encoding to close read.

#### How to Not Read a Victorian Novel

In this article, published in the *Journal of Victorian Culture* 16.1 (Spring 2011), Paul Fyfe outlines an assignment that draws on ready-made and freely-available online text analysis and visualizations tools to teach students how to create and interpret models of a single Victorian novel. By moving through the steps of text selection, preparation, model creation, and interpretation, students slow down to close read and engage in “self-conscious reflections about the limits, contingencies, and opportunities of alternative modes of interpretation.” Adaptable to any text-based humanities course, the assignment interrogates the apparent divide between close and distant reading and opens up questions of canon creation and readerly attention. The original assignment Fyfe describes in the article used the no longer supported [TAPoRware](http://taporware.ualberta.ca), but the [Voyant 2.0 tools](http://voyant-tools.org/) and would plug into this assignment just as well or better.

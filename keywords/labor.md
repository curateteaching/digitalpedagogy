## CURATORIAL STATEMENT 

### The spectrality of labor

The language of labor permeates pedagogic discourse.  Homework, showing your work, and other classic invocations of labor in the classroom ensure that students and instructors find the concepts of education and labor to be interminably entwined. In the digital environment, the conflation of labor with its product makes it challenging to ensure that those doing the work on digital projects receive proper credit and compensation.  

Student exposure to digital production in the classroom often takes the form of performing labor on a faculty project without credit or compensation (Keralis). Under the rubrics of skills building and exposure to active research, this has become a common, if not entirely unchallenged, practice in digital humanities. While these rubrics demonstrate the importance of digital projects, they collapse the many variable factors that guide the development of a project. The labor network necessary to produce digital projects is complex, and can include the knowledge work that serves as the intellectual foundation of a project, the physical labor of maintaining the infrastructure underlying these projects, hybrid labor “in which machines combine with humans to perform tasks” in software, scripted tasks performed automatically within systems and the writing of those scripts, and the instrumentalized labor of workers who perform repetitive tasks that cannot be scripted (Burgess & Hamming). An individual at one point on a project may be wholly unaware of the labor of others going on elsewhere.  Their labor is invisible and easily taken for granted. With apologies to Marx, if there is a spectre haunting digital pedagogy, it is labor. The aim of this collection of artifacts is to perform a séance, to make visible the spectral labor that haunts our shared digital house.

### Curation

As with [archival selection](https://digitalpedagogy.commons.mla.org/keywords/archive/), the labor choices made on digital projects reflect the values of those scholars and project managers, within the context of institutional realities (Coats & Dean). When student labor is invisible, their choices and values are elided with those of the visible authors and are rendered less valuable outside of the class assignment framework. 

We are not arguing against students doing “work” in class. Some form of intellectual or practical labor to demonstrate understanding and applied skills is a necessary cornerstone of most pedagogy. The digital learning environment offers potential for humanities educators to diversify the way students learn and demonstrate mastery in our classes beyond the traditional seminar paper. However, there are many considerations that instructors must make when integrating digital labor into their pedagogy. 

Most university policies recognize student work as [“Creator-Owned Intellectual Property”](https://research.unt.edu/sites/default/files/08-Intellectual%20Property_%20Research%20Intellectual%20Property_0.pdf) (UNT). Instructors must be careful not to obscure students’ right to proper attribution and give credit (in addition to a letter grade) for this work. There are also implications under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) for sharing student work online or using [social media](http://er.educause.edu/articles/2014/2/is-your-use-of-social-media-ferpa-compliant) in the classroom (UO). Bringing these policies into discussion can also give students a language for recognizing the degree to which they may want their labor to be made visible, and how it can be valued at their desired level of visibility.  Helping students understand the value and risks of digital labor in tandem with helping them develop digital skills can prepare them well for the diverse labor marketplace they will enter upon graduation. 

This process of parallel critique and creation does not have to be onerous for instructors or students. The artifacts below offer models for engaging students in an informed critique of some of the inequities of digital labor, while simultaneously fostering practical skills that are both useful and marketable outside the humanities. Combining some basic technical skills with a solid understanding of the realities of the complex digital labor marketplace can better position our students for success beyond the academy. By giving students assignments that help them recognize and understand the people who perform the labor behind the websites and widgets, we can equip them to be articulate advocates for the value of their work and the work of others. In a landscape in which there are many forces competing to alienate and obscure the labor of students, women, people of color, and the underclass of the digital workforce, equipping students to own their labor provides them with a crucial survival skill.

The artifacts selected here offer models for advocacy and evaluation, and exercises that provide students the opportunity to both produce their own digital project, and to reflect on the modes of production necessary to do that work.

Published by the UCLA Center for Digital Humanities, the *Bill of Rights* was developed in collaboration with students, based on their experiences in digital humanities classes. The *Bill of Rights* reflects on the power inequities that are inevitable when student labor in the classroom is used to support faculty projects. The *Bill of Rights* could be effectively integrated into course syllabi as an up-front, positive declaration of the rights of students. This document could also be used as a point of discussion for students, empowering them to value their labor and recognize inequities when they occur. Students might also be encouraged to look outside the humanities for other examples of student rights advocacy. Do the sciences, which have a longer history of collaboration between students and faculty, but also a mixed record on the ethical treatment of students, have similar documents? How can these values be naturalized throughout the academy without negative remedies?

Internships are routine components of many professional degrees, and are increasingly common in digital media pedagogy and the arts. The Digital Humanities Initiative at Hamilton College offers three fellowships for faculty and students to participate in a sustained collaboration. The program commits to funding student participants with a stipend, budget for research expenses, and funded conference attendance. This model avoids the pitfalls of unpaid internships in which students pay tuition - and accrue debt - for unpaid labor (Hickman, et al.). Notably, Hamilton College demonstrates a commitment beyond skills-building. Participation in a sustained research project provides additional professional development as a scholar and visible collaborator. This resource provides a model for advocacy, demonstrating how the internship process can relate to outcomes beyond the research project, and how both faculty and student values and decisions can be incorporated into such a framework.

Professionalization is a necessary but often invisible component of pedagogy, especially at the graduate level. However, students are often unaware of the processes underlying faculty appointment and retention, the adjunctification of teaching labor, and the architectures of power that shape and institutionalize these processes. Originally drafted in 2000, these criteria on evaluating digital work introduce questions of media specificity, accessibility, and roles and responsibilities on projects that can be useful in reviewing classroom projects, or when examining exemplar projects. When combined with the [Short Guide To Evaluation Of Digital Work](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/short-guide-to-evaluation-of-digital-work-by-geoffrey-rockwell/), students can be asked to examine how labor is assessed of its value by different mechanisms within the academic community. Students might be invited to use these criteria in thinking about their own potential career paths. What skills do they need to develop—including non-technical skills like budgeting and project management—that are not covered in their departmental curriculum?

*History Engine* purports to teach students “the craft of an historian” by giving them experience working with primary documents and related secondary sources, and writing analysis of the sources for public consumption. However, student authors are uncredited on the “episodes” they write, and author is not a searchable field within the database. *History Engine* can be used to empower students to ask questions about authorship and intellectual property. Useful exercises might include searching college websites to determine how much students paid per credit hour to contribute to the Engine, or discussing how to cite a work whose author has been rendered invisible. What does this invisibility teach them about “the craft of an historian”? Are there instances when it is more appropriate for student work to be anonymous? Are students aware of their rights under FERPA, and how these rights might be placed in dialogue, if not contrast, with their intellectual property rights?

This course examines the “real people in real places” who are involved in the transmission and storage of information. Through readings and hands-on exercises, students worked together to develop a digital publication, reflect on their methodology, explain the choices they made, and describe each team member’s role on the final project. The students’ final projects are available on the website, and each contributor is credited. Teamwork is a reality of digital labor that can be challenging to scholars accustomed to understanding their roles as sole author or single contributor. In this syllabus, student are able to examine their labors as the project develops, rather than at the end. These assignments enable students to develop valuable skills in both investigating and recovering the story of labor for these now ubiquitous objects.

If the syllabus constitutes a labor contract between the instructor and the student, the *Consent for Disclosure of Education Record* allows students to negotiate with the instructor and the institution to what degree their this labor may be made public (UO Libraries).  This negotiation is critical for classroom-based digital projects, as many platforms necessitate a public-facing output. The consent form provides three methods through which a student may participate according to their desired privacy level, while also providing information as to which activities will be private or public. The granularity of these options demonstrates that privacy and attribution do not have to be binary concepts when it comes to participation. This tool also provides students with an official, institution-sanctioned mechanism for asserting their rights without feeling that they are challenging the integrity of the instructor’s assignment. Including the form within a course also gives instructors a tangible means of enacting their commitment toward student rights, authorship, and privacy.

Incorporating digital projects into humanities survey courses can be a challenge, as covering a wide range of material is the primary mission of the course. In this assignment, the Timeline project assists with the heavy lifting of providing historical context for the works on the syllabus, and gives students exposure to thinking about information as data, doing research in online databases, and reflecting on the process of producing their contribution. Timeline JS, part of the Knight Labs Storyteller Toolkit, uses a Google Sheets template to feed into the Timeline platform, so students need not learn code to produce a visually compelling end product. The assignment adapts the UO FERPA release to give students the option of completing the assignment anonymously or offline. Students are given agency in how they complete the assignment, and ownership of their contribution to the final product. 

#### Millican “Riot,” 1868

Part of a growing suite of projects under Amy Earhart and Toneisha Taylor’s  *White Violence, Black Resistance* project, *Millican “Riot,” 1868* curates digital artifacts related to an early incident of race-motivated violence that has been effectively erased from the scholarly record. The project reflects on how events can be rendered invisible and demonstrates how digital platforms can recover these events by making artifacts visible to scholars and the public. This project offers a model of how Omeka.net (the free version of the platform) can be used for a class project in which students make individual, credited contributions. Students gain practical experience in metadata and controlled vocabularies, digitization, curation, and using content management systems. The exhibit provides another alternative model of digital publication, which could be enriched—either publicly or behind the scenes in the classroom—by the reflection component described in Posner’s or Keralis’s assignment.

This assignment gives students the opportunity to create their own website, with their own domain name, on which they can complete course assignments. While constructing a site provides students with some basic technical experience in working with a content management system such as Wordpress, the exercise also helps them become accustomed to sharing their work in a much larger environment than is typically expected for a class assignment. The option of blogging anonymously is offered, although the emphasis is on creating a web presence that can “rhetorically position yourself in relation to your studies and your career goals.” Building and populating a website also introduces students to the reality of the labor involved in building and maintaining a digital identity including a personal website, blogging, and across a variety of social media platforms. This care and feeding of online identity can itself be a full-time gig which is often effaced in academic workplaces.

The Grading Rubric for the final project of Miriam Posner’s *Digital Labor, Urban Space, and Materiality* course provides guidelines for specific feedback on student contributions to the course project. The evaluation of the Methodological Reflection includes criteria students should consider in their reflection, including an explicit call to document individual member choices. Here, methodology is framed as both the technical decisions guiding the product, and the values informing these decisions by the student authors. By encouraging students to reflect on their contributions to the team project, the assignment and accompanying rubric provides a mechanism for credit for individual contributions, and a means for students to hold each other accountable for their engagement with the team project. Students’ labor is recognized and assessed based at least in part on input from their peers.

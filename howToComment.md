## Update April 1, 2020 - WE'RE LIVE!
*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities* has emerged on its Modern Language Association platform in a beta form and being corrected live through June 2020. In light of the widespread move to online education at most universities, both the MLA staff and editors Davis, Gold, and Harris agreed that opening up the project in its post-peer review, copyedited state would be beneficial for everyone. Please join us in welcoming this long-standing project in its final platform into the world: [*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities*(https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/)

#How to Comment

This site is powered by [CommentPress](http://futureofthebook.org/commentpress/), which allows comments to be attached to individual paragraphs, whole pages, or an entire document. To comment on a keyword, click on its title in the right-hand navigation. To comment on a paragraph, click on the paragraph or on the speech bubble to its right; to comment on an entire page, click the link to Comments on the Whole Page, in the right-hand column. To leave general comments on the entire project, click the single comment bubble icon in the navigation bar.

Comments are moderated for first-time unregistered commenters, to prevent spam and to ensure that the comments comply with the [Guidelines for Participation](https://commons.mla.org/guidelines/); comments will not be filtered for content.

You can navigate the text using the bar across the top of the page; arrow buttons will take you forward and backward section by section, the closed-book button will return you to the title page, and the home icon will take you to the *MLA Commons* home page. The arrows at the far right will collapse or expand the text's header. You can also navigate by clicking directly on keyword titles in the right-hand navigation.

The relative widths of the main text column and the comments column can be changed by dragging the right edge of the main column.

CommentPress also presents three ways of reading comments on the text.  By clicking on the double comment bubble icon in the navigation bar, you can access all comments by page; in the list of pages, ordered by number of contents, clicking on the page title will cause the comments to expand and clicking on Comment in each comment's header will allow you to see that comment in its context. By clicking on the person icon in the navigation bar, you can read comments by author. Finally, the Activity tag above the right-hand column will show you the most recent comments left in the document.

If you have questions about the text's format, please feel free to leave them here.

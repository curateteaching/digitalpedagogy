#How to Comment

This site is powered
by[](http://futureofthebook.org/commentpress/)[CommentPress](http://futureofthebook.org/commentpress/),
which allows comments to be attached to individual paragraphs, whole
pages, or an entire document. To comment on a keyword, click on its
title in the right-hand navigation. To comment on a paragraph, click on
the paragraph or on the speech bubble to its right; to comment on an
entire page, click the link to Comments on the Whole Page, in the
right-hand column. To leave general comments on the entire project,
click the single comment bubble icon in the navigation bar.

\

Comments are moderated for first-time unregistered commenters, to
prevent spam and to ensure that the comments comply with the [Guidelines
for Participation](https://commons.mla.org/guidelines/); comments will
not be filtered for content.

\

You can navigate the text using the bar across the top of the page;
arrow buttons will take you forward and backward section by section, the
closed-book button will return you to the title page, and the home icon
will take you to the *MLA Commons* home page. The arrows at the far
right will collapse or expand the text’s header. You can also navigate
by clicking directly on keyword titles in the right-hand navigation.

\

The relative widths of the main text column and the comments column can
be changed by dragging the right edge of the main column.

\

CommentPress also presents three ways of reading comments on the text.
By clicking on the double comment bubble icon in the navigation bar, you
can access all comments by page; in the list of pages, ordered by number
of contents, clicking on the page title will cause the comments to
expand and clicking on Comment in each comment’s header will allow you
to see that comment in its context. By clicking on the person icon in
the navigation bar, you can read comments by author. Finally, the
Activity tag above the right-hand column will show you the most recent
comments left in the document.

\

If you have questions about the text’s format, please feel free to leave
them here.

## Update April 1, 2020 - WE'RE LIVE!
*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities* has emerged on its Modern Language Association platform in a beta form and being corrected live through June 2020. In light of the widespread move to online education at most universities, both the MLA staff and editors Davis, Gold, and Harris agreed that opening up the project in its post-peer review, copyedited state would be beneficial for everyone. Please join us in welcoming this long-standing project in its final platform into the world: [*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities*(https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/)

# Welcome

Welcome to the open peer-review site for _Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments_, a curated collection of reusable and remixable pedagogical artifacts for humanities scholars in development by the Modern Language Association.

Each keyword entry that you see on the right column of this site is curated by an experienced practitioner of digital pedagogy, who briefly contextualizes a pedagogical concept and then provides ten supporting artifacts, such as syllabi, prompts, exercises, lesson plans, and student work drawn from courses, classrooms, and projects across the humanities. These artifacts are annotated and accompanied by lists of related materials for further reading. The collection is published under a Creative Commons BY-NC license to encourage circulation, editing, and repurposing by other practitioners.

Eventually, fifty keywords will compose the project, which is currently undergoing public peer review. New keywords will be added in batches throughout 2015. We invite you to read through and respond to each of these entries, and we welcome feedback from a wide range of practitioners at all levels of experience. When commenting on keywords, please consider the following:

1. Clarity of curator's statement: Is the curator's rationale clear? Do the artifacts below it fulfill the promises of the curatorial statement?
2. Selection and presentation of artifacts: Does the keyword provide a broad range of sample artifacts? Are those artifacts annotated well? Are there any major gaps that should be addressed?
3. Applicability: Does the keyword provide a wide range of starting points for a scholar interested in engaging in digital pedagogy work?

While anyone may comment, we hope you'll join the MLA and become part of the _Commons_ community.

Thank you in advance for your feedback. Please visit our [how to comment](/how-to-comment) page if you have further questions about the process.
